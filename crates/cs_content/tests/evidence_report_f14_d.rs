//! Evidence-report harness for task F14-D (`docs/contracts/CLI-EVIDENCE.md`,
//! schema `schemas/evidence.schema.json`).
//!
//! This test is deliberately **not** named `accept_f14_d_*`: it is not part
//! of the acceptance suite, and it fails loudly when its inputs are missing
//! instead of passing vacuously. Run from the workspace root, after the
//! acceptance suite, exactly as:
//!
//! 1. ```sh
//!    mkdir -p private/evidence/F14-D
//!    cargo test --workspace --locked -- accept_f14_d_ --include-ignored \
//!      2>&1 | tee private/evidence/F14-D/cargo-test.log
//!    ```
//!    (record the pipeline's exit status; it is passed to this harness as
//!    `CS_EVIDENCE_EXIT_CODE`.)
//! 2. ```sh
//!    CS_EVIDENCE_DIR=private/evidence/F14-D \
//!    CS_CANDIDATE_TREE=$(git rev-parse 'HEAD^{tree}') \
//!    CS_EVIDENCE_ARGV="cargo test --workspace --locked -- accept_f14_d_ --include-ignored" \
//!    CS_EVIDENCE_EXIT_CODE=<status from step 1> \
//!      cargo test --locked --test evidence_report_f14_d -- --ignored
//!    ```
//! 3. ```sh
//!    python3 tools/validate_evidence.py private/evidence/F14-D/acceptance.json \
//!      --artifact-root private/evidence/F14-D --require-pass
//!    ```
//! 4. Commit a copy of `acceptance.json` as
//!    `docs/findings/evidence/F14-D.json`.
//!
//! Every field of the report is derived here from real inputs: the recorded
//! test log, the environment, production discovery of `$CS_GAME_DIR`, the
//! production baseline builder's own report over that installation (the
//! consumer trace), `rustc --version` and `Cargo.lock`. Nothing is typed in
//! by hand except two texts: the `review` block (which `CS_EVIDENCE_REVIEW`
//! fills in for the reviewing agent, and which otherwise says that review is
//! still pending) and the product-coverage limitations it quotes.
//!
//! `unknowns` is `[]` and the report validates with `--require-pass`: the
//! **task's** acceptance is complete — the inventory exists, the denominator
//! is fixed and every selected test passed. `tools/validate_evidence.py`
//! rejects a report whose `unknowns` hold unresolved *task* issues, so the
//! product-incompleteness state is moved, never deleted (the 2026-09-28
//! owner directive, and the same split `M01-A` documents): it lives in the
//! baseline report artifact this report hashes (`classified_reader_dirs`
//! and `collections`), in `review.method`, in `docs/findings/` and in the
//! follow-up tasks #388 and #389, and it keeps `is_retail_ready` false.
//! A failing run produces a failing report, which the validator rejects.
