//! Bevy composition, the Avian physics adapter, rendering, input, audio and UI.
//!
//! Owner crate per `docs/01-ARCHITECTURE.md`. The workspace bootstrap ships
//! the typed, asset-free [`synthetic`] development scene, the `cs` binary
//! entry point, its [`cli`] request parser and the [`run`] entry point that
//! executes a fixed-tick headless synthetic smoke. Rendering, input, audio, UI
//! and retail mission composition arrive with later F00+ tasks.
//!
//! [`origin`] is the world-origin frame of `specs/F16-coordinates-units-
//! origin-management-and-clocks.md`: an f64 `WorldOrigin` per epoch, its f32
//! local frame, the typed distinction between a rebase (world identity and
//! swept continuity survive) and a teleport, and (F16-B) the atomic
//! `OriginShift` transaction that converts a whole set of `SpatialAnchor`s
//! into a new frame. F16-C binds those anchors into a `SpatialWorld` and
//! drives them from the `cs_sim` frame clock through `FixedTickDriver`, so a
//! render frame's wall time only ever adds whole fixed ticks and equal input
//! at 30, 60 or 144 FPS yields the same state.
//!
//! [`livery`] is the F09-C consumer
//! (`specs/F09-bm-multilayer-liveries-and-paint-composition.md`, stage
//! `### F09-C`): per-model-instance faction and custom paints resolved
//! through a session-scoped composed-variant store, plus the construction
//! preview, teardown and retry the rendering stages (F17) drive.
//!
//! [`scene`] and [`airframe_visual`] are the F11-A ECS binding records
//! (`specs/F11-scene-hierarchy-aircraft-parts-sockets-and-lod.md`,
//! `### F11-A`): a generation-stamped [`scene::SceneNodeBinding`] tying an
//! entity to its canonical scene node, the [`scene::NodeVisualTransform`]
//! conversion of the one composed transform into a full-affine
//! `GlobalTransform`, and [`airframe_visual::AirframeVisual`] — the
//! airframe → scene-root reference by content id, never by array position.
//!
//! [`input`] is the F22-A application boundary
//! (`specs/F22-input-bindings-devices-and-control-ownership.md`,
//! `### F22-A`): the active action map and input context
//! ([`input::InputBindings`]) and the per-render-frame collector
//! ([`input::InputCollector`]) that resolves physical sources into the
//! ticked `cs_types::input::InputFrame` the simulation buffers. The device
//! adapters and axis calibration are F22-B.
